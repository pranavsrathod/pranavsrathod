## 👋 Hi, I'm Pranav Rathod

I’m a creative technologist and software engineer currently pursuing my **Master’s in Computer Science** at the **University of Southern California**, specializing in **Multimedia and Creative Technologies**.

My work explores the space where code meets creativity — whether it’s building **real-time renderers**, designing **interactive XR experiences**, or experimenting with **game engine systems**. I’m especially passionate about how software can be used as a tool for expression, storytelling, and interaction.
